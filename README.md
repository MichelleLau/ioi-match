# IOI Match (https://ioi-match.herokuapp.com/)

IOI Match (Indication of Interest) is an anonymous pre-matching block trading mechanism designed to create a safer and more efficient block trading market. IOI Match combines a reputation system with a ranked voting algorithm to create an incentive for brokers to police investor behavior and remove bad actors. IOI Match could be implemented for any asset classes, but this demo is focused on an equity market implementation.
